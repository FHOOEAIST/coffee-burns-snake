This project shows a performance comparision of Java and Python in the context of image processing. The comparision is done using different interpreters based on pure programming language specific implementations without any additional frameworks as well as comparisions based on state of the art frameworks. As foundation of the comparision we are using a simple kernel-based averaging filter on a greyscale image.

In addition to the state of the art frameworks we also compare the different implementations with our [Imaging](https://github.com/FHOOEAIST/imaging) project.

The idea of this project is based on the comparision of Pereira et. al in the context of energy efficiency across programming languages.
